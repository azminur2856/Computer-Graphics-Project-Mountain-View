A lively mountain with a river, river waves, trees, banyan trees, bushes, a windmill, houses, tents, the sky, the sun, the moon, clouds, fields, boats, birds, planes, a volcano, rain, snow, stars, and more has been created. Several types of views such as day, noon, afternoon, night, rain, volcano eruption, and snowfall have been included.

The river in the project has boats moving through it. Many trees exist on the banks of the large mountains in the project. A great view of snowfall appears in another view. Flying birds and planes are present, adding to the beauty of the project. The sunrise is another beautiful view included in the project. Each view has many differences, making them all very attractive and eye-catching.
